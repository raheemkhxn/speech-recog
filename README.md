OIBSIP_Speech Recognition
This project is a simple Speech Recognition program. It allows users to input their speech via a microphone and converts it to text, displaying the result on the screen. This can be used in various applications like voice commands, transcription, and hands-free control.

How It Works:
User Input:

The program prompts the user to speak into the microphone.
The audio input is then captured and processed to produce the text.
Main Functionalities:

Speech Recognition: Captures audio input and translates it into text.
Error Handling: Detects errors such as inability to understand audio or connectivity issues and provides relevant feedback.
Code Overview
Functions
recognize_speech():
Purpose: Captures audio from the user and converts it into text.
How it Works: Uses the speech_recognition library to listen to audio and utilizes Google’s Web Speech API to process and convert audio into text. If the program cannot understand the audio or if there’s an issue with the API connection, it displays an appropriate error message.
Functions

python
Copy code
import speech_recognition as sr

def recognize_speech():
    """Capture and recognize speech using Google Web Speech API."""
    # Initialize the recognizer
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

    # Use the default microphone as the audio source
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Please say something...")
        # Listen for the user's input
        audio_data = recognizer.listen(source)
        print("Recognizing...")

        try:
            # Convert audio to text
            text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
            print("You said:", text)
            return text
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            print("Sorry, I could not understand the audio.")
        except sr.RequestError:
            print("Request failed; check your internet connection or API settings.")
recognizer: Creates an instance of the Recognizer class to handle speech recognition.
Microphone: Sets up the microphone as the input device for capturing audio.
listen(source): Records audio from the microphone and waits for a pause in speech to stop recording.
recognize_google(audio_data): Sends the recorded audio to Google’s Web Speech API, which returns the audio in text format.
Main Program
The recognize_speech() function initiates the program, prompts for user input, and displays the recognized text on the screen. It also provides clear feedback if the audio could not be processed, ensuring a smooth user experience.
